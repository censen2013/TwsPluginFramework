/**
 * Represents a value that will be made available asynchronously
 * <p/>
 * A future is pending until it either succeeds or fails. It's possible to register callbacks for those events and to
 * compose multiple futures together in various ways.
 * <p/>
 * The good thing about a future is that it might have a value available already or it might get a value in the
 * future, but it can be dealt with exactly the same way regardless. Therefore, the user don't need to add any special
 * cases for whether the future is still pending or not. Also, by chaining multiple futures together it's possible to
 * automatically abort on the first error and have any errors forwarded to the end of the chain for you (instead of
 * having to handle errors at each step in the chain). This is basically asynchronous exception handling.
 * <p/>
 * These futures are intentionally not thread safe, so only use them on a single thread at a time. If you do work on
 * a background thread and return a future, you need to communicate with your background thread without touching the
 * futures on the background thread. See the BackgroundRunner classes for ways of conveniently doing this.
